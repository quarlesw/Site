    I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  summary: |
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I’m a Clinical Data Scientist at the FDA, and my passion is translating advanced analytics into life-changing health outcomes. From pioneering Bayesian approaches for low-frequency adverse events to rescuing messy data sets with multiple imputation (MICE), I thrive on taking high-stakes challenges and turning them into actionable insights that protect and improve patient well-being. My work has underpinned major regulatory decisions (even if I can’t discuss most of them) and earned me a Young Investigator Award for exploring how targeted nutrition interventions might enhance cognitive function in children facing food insecurity.\
\
Yet I don’t just crunch numbers—I champion a leadership philosophy inspired by deep work principles. I believe quality beats quantity every time, and that a supportive, focused team can achieve truly transformative results. Whether I’m guiding junior researchers, navigating complex regulatory landscapes, or engineering new data validation systems, I approach every project with a fierce commitment to rigor, clarity, and real-world impact.\
\
Over the years, I’ve proven I’m not afraid to dive into the messiness of clinical data—those grey areas where most statisticians tap out—and find solutions that shape policy. I’m here to push boundaries, from refining the ways we collect data to rethinking how we interpret it. My ultimate goal? To lead the charge in modernizing healthcare analytics, so that every piece of information gleaned from trials translates into genuine benefits for patients worldwide.\
\
If you’re looking for a forward-thinking data leader—someone as adept at advanced methodologies as at rallying teams toward a shared vision—I’m ready to deliver. Let’s unlock the full potential of data to create a healthier future, together.
